# Piano Harmony Generator using Encoder-Decoder model

#### Introduction
This project uses RNN encoder-decoder model to predict the harmony (left hand) sequence given the melody (right hand) sequence.
Generated harmony demonstration can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEof6vc0t9I): 

#### Brief Instructions
1. If you are interested in testing the trained model, you can load the weights in weights_epoch_60 folder. They are trained with batch size 1, 8, 16 and number of units 64, 128, 256, on epoch number 60. Be sure to change the latent_dim variable to the corresponding value.
2. Note: For epoch number 60, batch size 8 and 16 performed very bad. Please train them by more epochs, which can give you a better harmony like the demonstration showed (the harmony in the demonstration is generated by model trained with batch size 16 and number of unit 256 on epoch 120) . Batch size 1 performs well on epoch 60.
3. If you want to train the weights by more epochs, change the last parameter "cont" in compile_and_train function to be True. The function will load the weight from output_file_path and train by the number of epochs you pass in.
